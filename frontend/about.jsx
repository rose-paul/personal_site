      <article>
      My previous work teaching at tech companies in Moscow introduced me to the spellbinding realm of software
       development: the challenge of problem-solving and designing systems, the fun of building, and the potential for making 
       impactful products and experiences.

        Fast-forward from that initial enchantment to now: I have several 
        engineering projects using a range of technologies. 
        Iâ€™m especially adept at JavaScript, React and the surrounding eco-system.

        Outside of programming, I love to travel. I was fortunate to explore a
        lot of places during my time in Moscow, both in the country and the
        surrounding region. This photo is from the Krasnodar region on top of
        the mountain Indyuk.
